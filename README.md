Breaker-vim 是一个集成了多种插件的vim配置，支持vim，Gvim和[MacVim]
breaker-vim 适合作为一个IDE。并且在各种平台上运行良好，包括 Linux, \*nix and Mac.
本配置文件有强大的自定义功能，用户可以添加自己的配置到  `~/.vimrc.local`, `~/.vimrc.bundles.local`, and `~/.vimrc.before.local`.

![Breaker-vim image][Breaker-vim-img]

与传统的vim插件文件结构不通，breaker-vim使用Vimdle插件管理vim插件，这样更有利于vim插件的增加、删除和更新

# 安装
## 需求
[neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim)插件需要[vim支持lua](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim#requirements).
你可能需要重新编译vim让其支持lua，因为默认vim不支持lua。

## Linux, \*nix, Mac OSX 安装

最简单的安装方式是使用[安装器](https://coding.net/u/breaker/p/vimrc/git/raw/master/bootstrap.sh)安装.拷贝和粘贴并执行下面的命令. 
安装器会首先备份你vim之前的配置，当你已经安装过breaker-vim，并不会备份，只会升级插件以及配置到最新版本。

* 要求安装 Git 1.7+ 和 Vim 7.3+*

```bash

    curl https://coding.net/u/breaker/p/vimrc/git/raw/master/bootstrap.sh -L > breaker-vim.sh && sh breaker-vim.sh
```

或者:
```bash

    sh <(curl https://coding.net/u/breaker/p/vimrc/git/raw/master/bootstrap.sh -L)
```

## 升级到最新版本
升级插件和配置最简单和最安全的方式就是使用安装器。使用以下命令:

```bash

    curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ibreaker/vimrc/master/bootstrap.sh -L -o - | sh

```

或者你可以手动指向下面的命令，如果文件结构有所改变，你需要创建相应的符号链接。

```bash
    cd $HOME/to/breaker-vim/
    git pull
    vim +BundleInstall! +BundleClean +q
```

### Fork me on GitHub

很乐意接收PRs。现在已经有很多人为[Breaker-vim]贡献代码，请fork项目。

# 一个高度可配置的.vim coding项目

![Breaker-vimrc image][Breaker-vimrc-img]

The .vimrc file is suited to programming. It is extremely well organized and folds in sections.
Each section is labeled and each option is commented.

It fixes many of the inconveniences of vanilla vim including

 * A single config can be used across Windows, Mac and linux
 * Eliminates swap and backup files from littering directories, preferring to store in a central location.
 * Fixes common typos like :W, :Q, etc
 * Setup a solid set of settings for Formatting (change to meet your needs)
 * Setup the interface to take advantage of vim's features including
   * omnicomplete
   * line numbers
   * syntax highlighting
   * A better ruler & status line
   * & more
 * Configuring included plugins

## Customization

Create `~/.vimrc.local` and `~/.gvimrc.local` for any local
customizations.

For example, to override the default color schemes:

```bash
    echo colorscheme ir_black  >> ~/.vimrc.local
```

### Before File

Create a `~/.vimrc.before.local` file to define any customizations
that get loaded *before* the breaker-vim `.vimrc`.

For example, to prevent autocd into a file directory:
```bash
    echo let g:breaker_no_autochdir = 1 >> ~/.vimrc.before.local
```
For a list of available breaker-vim specific customization options, look at the `~/.vimrc.before` file.


### Fork Customization

There is an additional tier of customization available to those who want to maintain a
fork of Breaker-vim specialized for a particular group. These users can create `.vimrc.fork`
and `.vimrc.bundles.fork` files in the root of their fork.  The load order for the configuration is:

1. `.vimrc.before` - Breaker-vim before configuration
2. `.vimrc.before.fork` - fork before configuration
3. `.vimrc.before.local` - before user configuration
4. `.vimrc.bundles` - Breaker-vim bundle configuration
5. `.vimrc.bundles.fork` - fork bundle configuration
6. `.vimrc.bundles.local` - local user bundle configuration
6. `.vimrc` - Breaker-vim vim configuration
7. `.vimrc.fork` - fork vim configuration
8. `.vimrc.local` - local user configuration

See `.vimrc.bundles` for specifics on what options can be set to override bundle configuration. See `.vimrc.before` for specifics
on what options can be overridden. Most vim configuration options should be set in your `.vimrc.fork` file, bundle configuration
needs to be set in your `.vimrc.bundles.fork` file.

You can specify the default bundles for your fork using `.vimrc.before.fork` file. Here is how to create an example `.vimrc.before.fork` file
in a fork repo for the default bundles.
```bash
    echo let g:breaker_bundle_groups=[\'general\', \'programming\', \'misc\', \'youcompleteme\'] >> .vimrc.before.fork
```
Once you have this file in your repo, only the bundles you specified will be installed during the first installation of your fork.

You may also want to update your `README.markdown` file so that the `bootstrap.sh` link points to your repository and your `bootstrap.sh`
file to pull down your fork.


### Easily Editing Your Configuration

`<Leader>ev` opens a new tab containing the .vimrc configuration files listed above. This makes it easier to get an overview of your
configuration and make customizations.

`<Leader>sv` sources the .vimrc file, instantly applying your customizations to the currently running vim instance.

These two mappings can themselves be customized by setting the following in .vimrc.before.local:
```bash
let g:breaker_edit_config_mapping='<Leader>ev'
let g:breaker_apply_config_mapping='<Leader>sv'
```

# Plugins

Breaker-vim contains a curated set of popular vim plugins, colors, snippets and syntaxes. Great care has been made to ensure that these plugins play well together and have optimal configuration.

## Adding new plugins

Create `~/.vimrc.bundles.local` for any additional bundles.

To add a new bundle, just add one line for each bundle you want to install. The line should start with the word "Bundle" followed by a string of either the vim.org project name or the githubusername/githubprojectname. For example, the github project [spf13/vim-colors](https://github.com/spf13/vim-colors) can be added with the following command

```bash
    echo Bundle \'spf13/vim-colors\' >> ~/.vimrc.bundles.local
```

Once new plugins are added, they have to be installed.

```bash
    vim +BundleInstall! +BundleClean +q
```

## Removing (disabling) an included plugin

Create `~/.vimrc.local` if it doesn't already exist.

Add the UnBundle command to this line. It takes the same input as the Bundle line, so simply copy the line you want to disable and add 'Un' to the beginning.

For example, disabling the 'AutoClose' and 'scrooloose/syntastic' plugins

```bash
    echo UnBundle \'AutoClose\' >> ~/.vimrc.bundles.local
    echo UnBundle \'scrooloose/syntastic\' >> ~/.vimrc.bundles.local
```

**Remember to run ':BundleClean!' after this to remove the existing directories**


Here are a few of the plugins:


## [Undotree]

If you undo changes and then make a new change, in most editors the changes you undid are gone forever, as their undo-history is a simple list.
Since version 7.0 vim uses an undo-tree instead. If you make a new change after undoing changes, a new branch is created in that tree.
Combined with persistent undo, this is nearly as flexible and safe as git ;-)

Undotree makes that feature more accessible by creating a visual representation of said undo-tree.

**QuickStart** Launch using `<Leader>u`.

## [NERDTree]

NERDTree is a file explorer plugin that provides "project drawer"
functionality to your vim editing.  You can learn more about it with
`:help NERDTree`.

**QuickStart** Launch using `<Leader>e`.

**Customizations**:

* Use `<C-E>` to toggle NERDTree
* Use `<leader>e` or `<leader>nt` to load NERDTreeFind which opens NERDTree where the current file is located.
* Hide clutter ('\.pyc', '\.git', '\.hg', '\.svn', '\.bzr')
* Treat NERDTree more like a panel than a split.

## [ctrlp]
Ctrlp replaces the Command-T plugin with a 100% viml plugin. It provides an intuitive and fast mechanism to load files from the file system (with regex and fuzzy find), from open buffers, and from recently used files.

**QuickStart** Launch using `<c-p>`.

## [Surround]

This plugin is a tool for dealing with pairs of "surroundings."  Examples
of surroundings include parentheses, quotes, and HTML tags.  They are
closely related to what Vim refers to as text-objects.  Provided
are mappings to allow for removing, changing, and adding surroundings.

Details follow on the exact semantics, but first, consider the following
examples.  An asterisk (*) is used to denote the cursor position.

      Old text                  Command     New text ~
      "Hello *world!"           ds"         Hello world!
      [123+4*56]/2              cs])        (123+456)/2
      "Look ma, I'm *HTML!"     cs"<q>      <q>Look ma, I'm HTML!</q>
      if *x>3 {                 ysW(        if ( x>3 ) {
      my $str = *whee!;         vllllS'     my $str = 'whee!';

For instance, if the cursor was inside `"foo bar"`, you could type
`cs"'` to convert the text to `'foo bar'`.

There's a lot more, check it out at `:help surround`

## [NERDCommenter]

NERDCommenter allows you to wrangle your code comments, regardless of
filetype. View `help :NERDCommenter` or checkout my post on ![NERDCommenter][NERD-Tree].

**QuickStart** Toggle comments using `<Leader>c<space>` in Visual or Normal mode.

## [neocomplete]

Neocomplete is an amazing autocomplete plugin with additional support for snippets. It can complete simulatiously from the dictionary, buffer, omnicomplete and snippets. This is the one true plugin that brings Vim autocomplete on par with the best editors.

**QuickStart** Just start typing, it will autocomplete where possible

**Customizations**:

 * Automatically present the autocomplete menu
 * Support tab and enter for autocomplete
 * `<C-k>` for completing snippets using [Neosnippet](https://github.com/Shougo/neosnippet.vim).

![neocomplete image][autocomplete-img]

## [YouCompleteMe]

YouCompleteMe is another amazing completion engine. It is slightly more involved to set up as it contains a binary component that the user needs to compile before it will work. As a result of this however it is very fast.

To enable YouCompleteMe add `youcompleteme` to your list of groups by overriding it in your `.vimrc.before.local` like so: `let g:breaker_bundle_groups=['general', 'programming', 'misc', 'scala', 'youcompleteme']` This is just an example. Remember to choose the other groups you want here.

Once you have done this you will need to get Vundle to grab the latest code from git. You can do this by calling `:BundleInstall!`. You should see YouCompleteMe in the list.

You will now have the code in your bundles directory and can proceed to compile the core. Change to the directory it has been downloaded to. If you have a vanilla install then `cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe/` should do the trick. You should see a file in this directory called install.sh. There are a few options to consider before running the installer:

  * Do you want clang support (if you don't know what this is then you likely don't need it)?
    * Do you want to link against a local libclang or have the installer download the latest for you?
  * Do you want support for c# via the omnisharp server?

The plugin is well documented on the site linked above. Be sure to give that a read and make sure you understand the options you require.

For java users wanting to use eclim be sure to add `let g:EclimCompletionMethod = 'omnifunc'` to your .vimrc.local.

## [Syntastic]

Syntastic is a syntax checking plugin that runs buffers through external syntax
checkers as they are saved and opened. If syntax errors are detected, the user
is notified and is happy because they didn't have to compile their code or
execute their script to find them.

## [AutoClose]

AutoClose does what you expect. It's simple, if you open a bracket, paren, brace, quote,
etc, it automatically closes it. It handles curlys correctly and doesn't get in the
way of double curlies for things like jinja and twig.

## [Fugitive]

Fugitive adds pervasive git support to git directories in vim. For more
information, use `:help fugitive`

Use `:Gstatus` to view `git status` and type `-` on any file to stage or
unstage it. Type `p` on a file to enter `git add -p` and stage specific
hunks in the file.

Use `:Gdiff` on an open file to see what changes have been made to that
file

**QuickStart** `<leader>gs` to bring up git status

**Customizations**:

 * `<leader>gs` :Gstatus<CR>
 * `<leader>gd` :Gdiff<CR>
 * `<leader>gc` :Gcommit<CR>
 * `<leader>gb` :Gblame<CR>
 * `<leader>gl` :Glog<CR>
 * `<leader>gp` :Git push<CR>
 * `<leader>gw` :Gwrite<CR>
 * :Git ___ will pass anything along to git.

![fugitive image][fugitive-img]

## [PIV]

The most feature complete and up to date PHP Integration for Vim with proper support for PHP 5.3+ including latest syntax, functions, better fold support, etc.

PIV provides:

 * PHP 5.3 support
 * Auto generation of PHP Doc (,pd on (function, variable, class) definition line)
 * Autocomplete of classes, functions, variables, constants and language keywords
 * Better indenting
 * Full PHP documentation manual (hit K on any function for full docs)

![php vim itegration image][phpmanual-img]

## [Ack.vim]

Ack.vim uses ack to search inside the current directory for a pattern.
You can learn more about it with `:help Ack`

**QuickStart** :Ack

## [Tabularize]

Tabularize lets you align statements on their equal signs and other characters

**Customizations**:

 * `<Leader>a= :Tabularize /=<CR>`
 * `<Leader>a: :Tabularize /:<CR>`
 * `<Leader>a:: :Tabularize /:\zs<CR>`
 * `<Leader>a, :Tabularize /,<CR>`
 * `<Leader>a<Bar> :Tabularize /<Bar><CR>`

## [Tagbar]

Breaker-vim includes the Tagbar plugin. This plugin requires exuberant-ctags and will automatically generate tags for your open files. It also provides a panel to navigate easily via tags

**QuickStart** `CTRL-]` while the cursor is on a keyword (such as a function name) to jump to its definition.

**Customizations**: Breaker-vim binds `<Leader>tt` to toggle the tagbar panel

![tagbar image][tagbar-img]

**Note**: For full language support, run `brew install ctags` to install
exuberant-ctags.

**Tip**: Check out `:help ctags` for information about VIM's built-in
ctag support. Tag navigation creates a stack which can traversed via
`Ctrl-]` (to find the source of a token) and `Ctrl-T` (to jump back up
one level).

## [EasyMotion]

EasyMotion provides an interactive way to use motions in Vim.

It quickly maps each possible jump destination to a key allowing very fast and
straightforward movement.

**QuickStart** EasyMotion is triggered using the normal movements, but prefixing them with `<leader><leader>`

For example this screen shot demonstrates pressing `,,w`

![easymotion image][easymotion-img]

## [Airline]

Airline provides a lightweight themable statusline with no external dependencies. By default this configuration uses the symbols `‹` and `›` as separators for different statusline sections but can be configured to use the same symbols as [Powerline]. An example first without and then with powerline symbols is shown here:

![airline image][airline-img]

To enable powerline symbols first install one of the [Powerline Fonts] or patch your favorite font using the provided instructions. Configure your terminal, MacVim, or Gvim to use the desired font. Finally add `let g:airline_powerline_fonts=1` to your `.vimrc.before.local`.

## Additional Syntaxes

Breaker-vim ships with a few additional syntaxes:

* Markdown (bound to \*.markdown, \*.md, and \*.mk)
* Twig
* Git commits (set your `EDITOR` to `mvim -f`)

## Amazing Colors

Breaker-vim includes [solarized] and [spf13 vim color pack](https://github.com/spf13/vim-colors/):

* ir_black
* molokai
* peaksea

Use `:color molokai` to switch to a color scheme.

Terminal Vim users will benefit from solarizing their terminal emulators and setting solarized support to 16 colors:

    let g:solarized_termcolors=16
    color solarized

Terminal emulator colorschemes:

* http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized (iTerm2, Terminal.app)
* https://github.com/phiggins/konsole-colors-solarized (KDE Konsole)
* https://github.com/sigurdga/gnome-terminal-colors-solarized (Gnome Terminal)

## Snippets

It also contains a very complete set of [snippets](https://github.com/spf13/snipmate-snippets) for use with snipmate or [neocomplete].


# Intro to VIM

Here's some tips if you've never used VIM before:

## Tutorials

* Type `vimtutor` into a shell to go through a brief interactive
  tutorial inside VIM.


## Modes

* VIM has two (common) modes:
  * insert mode- stuff you type is added to the buffer
  * normal mode- keys you hit are interpreted as commands
* To enter insert mode, hit `i`
* To exit insert mode, hit `<ESC>`

## Useful commands

* Use `:q` to exit vim
* Certain commands are prefixed with a `<Leader>` key, which by default maps to `\`.
  Breaker-vim uses `let mapleader = ","` to change this to `,` which is in a consistent and
  convenient location.
* Keyboard [cheat sheet](http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif).
